NodeServer
==========

For a class project I made a very basic Node.js server. It has the sole function of serving a source document requested by the user on the address bar.

Simply begin running the node server bestwebserver.js. I included the file calculator.html as an example of a document to be served. Type in localhost:8080/calculator.html and you will get the simple calculator page.
